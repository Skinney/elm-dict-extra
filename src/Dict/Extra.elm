{-| Takes a key-fn and a list.
Creates a `Dict` which maps the key to a list of matching elements.

    mary = {id=1, name="Mary"}
    jack = {id=2, name="Jack"}
    jill = {id=1, name="Jill"}
    groupBy .id [mary, jack, jill] == Dict.fromList [(1, [jill, mary]), (2, [jack])]
-}
groupBy : (a -> comparable) -> List a -> Dict comparable (List a)
groupBy keyfn list =
    List.foldl
        (\x acc ->
            Dict.update (keyfn x) (Maybe.map ((::) x) >> Maybe.withDefault [ x ] >> Just) acc
        )
        Dict.empty
        list


{-| Create a dictionary from a list of values, by passing a function that can get a key from any such value.
If the function does not return unique keys, earlier values are discarded.
This can, for instance, be useful when constructing Dicts from a List of records with `id` fields:

    jack = {id=2, name="Jack"}
    jill = {id=1, name="Jill"}
    fromListBy .id [jack, jill] == Dict.fromList [(1, jack), (2, jill)]
-}
fromListBy : (a -> comparable) -> List a -> Dict comparable a
fromListBy keyfn xs =
    List.foldl (\x acc -> Dict.insert (keyfn x) x acc) Dict.empty xs


{-| Remove elements which satisfies the predicate.

    removeWhen (\c v -> v == 1) Dict.fromList [("Mary", 1), ("Jack", 2), ("Jill", 1)] == Dict.fromList [("Jack", 2)]
-}
removeWhen : (comparable -> v -> Bool) -> Dict comparable v -> Dict comparable v
removeWhen pred dict =
    Dict.filter (\k v -> not (pred k v)) dict


{-| Remove a key-value pair if its key appears in the set.
-}
removeMany : Set comparable -> Dict comparable v -> Dict comparable v
removeMany set dict =
    Set.foldl Dict.remove dict set


{-| Keep a key-value pair if its key appears in the set.
-}
keepOnly : Set comparable -> Dict comparable v -> Dict comparable v
keepOnly set dict =
    Set.foldl
        (\k acc ->
            Maybe.withDefault acc <| Maybe.map (\v -> Dict.insert k v acc) (Dict.get k dict)
        )
        Dict.empty
        set
